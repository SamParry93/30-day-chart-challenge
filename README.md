# 30-day-chart-challenge
Attemps at the 2025 30 Day Chart Challenge - albeit a month late to the party due to Actuarial exams taking precedent!

Here are the prompts for each day - to which I'll be producing visualisations, extending on my coding knowledge in R to also include D3, observable JS and Python.
